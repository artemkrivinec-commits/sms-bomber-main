# Let's try the first one :trollface:
## Step 1: Install updates

```
apt update -y && apt upgrade -y
```

## Step 2: Install python & prerequisites

```
pkg install git && pkg install python && pip install urllib3
```


## Step 3: Get install bomber tools

```
git clone https://github.com/NiREvil/sms-bomber
```



## Step 4: Tool directory

```
cd sms-bomber
```


## Last step 5: Run

```
python sms-bomber.py
```

> **please pay attention**
> Now the script is running and it asks for the mobile number of that asshole.
> > The prefix 98 is already written, so you just need to enter the remaining number without the zero, for example, `914860876`.
> > > In the next step, you can change the speed of sending messages, but I have set it to the maximum, so it's better not to change it and just press the enter key to run it. Return result only.
        
### And BoOoOom :bomb: :fire: :ghost:

------
> ### A few points:
> The execution site for all SMS bombers, should always have **VPN turned off.** Always Always.
> > To stop the bomber, use the keys `ctrl + C` and for exit use `ctrl + D`
> > > If your terminal is unable to clone the files, download it [from here](https://github.com/NiREvil/sms-bomber/blob/main/sms-bomber.py)
> > > and then use the command `cd downloads` in the program instead of the command cd sms-bomber ,
cause the directory or location of the tool is now in the downloads folder of your phone's storage .
> > > > You can see which folder you are currently in with the command `pwd`.
> > > > and the contents inside the folder will be displayed for you with the command `ls` .
> > > > Use the command `cd` followed by the name of the desired folder to navigate to that path.


be curious. 🤍🪐
